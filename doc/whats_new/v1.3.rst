Version 1.3.0
=============

**In Development**

.. include:: changelog_legend.inc

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

- |Enhancement| Experimental engine API (no backward compatibility guarantees)
  to allow for external packages to contribute alternative implementations for
  the core computational routines of some selected scikit-learn estimators.

  Currently, the following estimators allow alternative implementations:

  - :class:`~sklearn.cluster.KMeans` (only for the LLoyd algorithm).
  - TODO: add more when available.

  External engine providers include:

  - https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex that provided a KMeans
    engine optimized for OpenCL enabled GPUs.
  - TODO: add more here

  :pr:`24497` by :user:`ogrisel`, :user:`fcharras` and :user:`betatim`.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.
